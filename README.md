# Forsaken
An attempt at making a rougelike game in python using pygame for my 2nd CT12 Independent Project.

This is open-source so I can hand it in easily and so that in the future, if people would like to, reference/use my code for their projects. Do note that most of this may break as time goes on, because it's my first project using pygame, i'm not that confident in it.
